# Resort Reservation System


This is a hotel reservation system and it was developed for my collage assignment by me. I use raw php as a scripting language along with bootstrap, Jquery etc. frameworks for front end. To prove myself to the lecturers that I as a student can develop a system like this in raw php rather than heavily reling on some advanced frameworks. However, one of the important package I used on this project is Dwoo a php template engine in which I render and mix html layout pages and content pages.

The site is launched as a demo via following link
